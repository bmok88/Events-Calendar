# Events-Calendar

Schedule events on this calendar UI and take snapshots to group the events together. I intended to keep this project frontend only, as I wanted to master React-Redux along with HTML5/CSS3. Possible future implementations for a full stack application would include a Node/Express server with MySQL as the database. For now, a React-Redux UI will do =).
